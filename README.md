Game Jam Game created by Warren Wheeler

The Game Jam was a school project for which we had to make an entire video game in a week. The theme was "It's Spreading," but with the recent Corona Virus outbreak, I wanted to go in a different direction. I hope you enjoy the game!

Included in this repository are a Windows Installer, an OSX App, and the Unity Project Folder.
